# Hi.

I'm Blair, a passionate data enthusiast who loves uncovering hidden patterns and weaving compelling narratives from data. My journey into Data Science began in 2020 when I dived into R programming during my industrial placement year. The power of transforming data into stunning visualisations and even building an app captivated me, and I have been hooked ever since.

Currently, I'm broadening my horizons in _Data Science_ with a Masters at Loughborough University. Here, I've had the opportunity to delve into various projects, each a fascinating blend of Machine Learning, Big Data, and software development. These experiences honed my strategic insights and knack for writing efficient code.

Before joining Loughborough, I graduated from the University of Leeds, earning a First-Class Honours in _Neuroscience_ and being named on the Dean's list. I look forward to continuing my journey, unearthing insights, learning new skills and publishing my work here!
